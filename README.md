# Socom-Combined-Assault-Discord-Presence

This is a standalone program to update your discord presence when playing SOCOM Combined Assault through PCSX2. 
This does not contain any stat tracking or interface enhancements.

All maps will show the same image for till I am able to get decent images of all maps.
